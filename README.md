# World's resource production and consumption Visualizaion using D3 Library

This project provides exploratory visualization to analyze energy production and consumption data from around the world.

The dataset use is compiled by the US Energy Information Administration. It includes data on the energy produced and consumed by most world countries between 1980 and 2012. 

The amount of energy is broken down by different energy types (petroleum, renewables, natural gas, coal, electricity).

The goal of this project is to look at how the above variables have been changing over time, and to try to look for relationships between energy consumption rates and carbon emissions for different countries and/or world regions.
